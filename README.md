I started by checking for duplicate
I took out rows I thaught were not important e.g row ID, order ID and postal code for sensitivity reasons
I went further to change numbers to currency
Then analyzed the data  to find insights such as, top performing sales in state, region, segments etc
And lastly Visualization
